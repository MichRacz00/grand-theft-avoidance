#Grand Theft Avoidance

This web application showcases statistics regarding article losses
occurred in a chain of stores. Application displays those statistics
using a variety of graphs. Users can also access some basic information
regarding the products. Some administrative capabilities are also
implemented albeit limited.

Different accounts can have different levels of security therefore an
account for each security level is included. Account store is dedicated
for a store manager and only displays one particular store assigned
to this account. Division account is dedicated to a division manager
and is used to access all the stores in the chain. Admin account can
be used to carry out administrative duties such as removing or adding
users and locations to the system.


Some credentials helpful for testing:
credentials take a form of tuple (login, password, clerance level)

(Store, s, 1)
(Division, d, 2)
(Admin, a, 3)
